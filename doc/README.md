Setup
---------------------
[Methuselah Core](https://github.com/methuselah-coin/methuselah/releases) is the original METHUSELAH client and it builds the backbone of the network. However, it downloads and stores the entire history of METHUSELAH transactions; depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few minutes to hours or a day or more. Thankfully you only have to do this once.
